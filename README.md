1. MgNet_out_selected_events_predicted_Mws.py gives out the predicted magnitudes for the selected 4 events based on different percentages of rupture onsets.
2. MgNet_predicted_acc_rupture_onset_process.py outputs the magnitude-estimation accuracies of MgNet based on different percentages of rupture onsets.
3. MgNet_characteristic_time_determine_Mw.py analyzes the MgNet'S characteristic time to determine the final magnitude of large earthquakes at the stage when magnitude-estimation accuracy is stable.
